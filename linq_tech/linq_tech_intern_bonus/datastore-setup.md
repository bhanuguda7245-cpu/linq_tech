# Datastore Setup

I chose **MongoDB (local)** because:

- Easy to set up locally for development.
- Handles JSON-like data (flexible schema).
- Supports quick aggregation for trend visualization.

## Setup

1. Install MongoDB Community Edition locally.
2. Ensure the MongoDB server is running at `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
3. Run `datastore_setup.py` to create the database and collection.
